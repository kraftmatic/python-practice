# Python Practice

This is literally a repository to move practice python files between computers depending on where I happen to be when I decide to play around with this.  There is nothing special contained within as I am basically familiarizing myself with the Python3 syntax and nothing more.  Should I see anyone star or fork this I shall pray to whatever deity is requested for the redemption of their soul.
